# Potential Social Discussion Topics/Questions

Once a topic is used, remove it from this document and put it in [used_posts.md](used_posts.md).

- Is it "the data is" or "the data are," i.e. is the word data singular or plural? And does your belief match the way the words naturally come out of your mouth in conversation?
- Find and post a cartoon about data. You might already have a favorite, or you can search the internet for “data cartoons.” Many of the DART team’s favorites are by Randall Munroe of xkcd.com.
- Give a six word description of what you do. This could be silly or serious, and certainly won’t be long enough to get into much detail. Examples might be:
    - “Teach biomedical researchers to “data” better.”
    - “Make mice sick, learn about cancer.”
    - “Stain kids to see their organs.”
- Share your favorite (or least favorite, or most common) error message. What do you do when it appears?
- What is a technical term in your field that sounds like something different (or confusing or weird) to people outside of your subfield or community? For example GitHub users talk about "forking" a repository, which means making a copy of it that they can then use and modify however they like.
- Share a data visualization you have particularly enjoyed. It might be from a news article, scientific journal, really anywhere as long as it is public. Or share a bad data visualization and explain why it is so bad. Many examples are available at https://badvisualisations.tumblr.com/.
- Share a story of missing or wrong data. It could be something minor, or a major problem like the California man who got the [license plate NULL for his car](https://www.wired.com/story/null-license-plate-landed-one-hacker-ticket-hell/).
- Find and post a cartoon that speaks to your experience with the program or with coding so far.
