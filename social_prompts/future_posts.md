# Potential Social Discussion Topics/Questions

Once a topic is used, remove it from this document and put it in [used_posts.md](used_posts.md).

- Share your favorite (or least favorite, or most common) error message. What do you do when it appears?
- Share a data visualization you have particularly enjoyed. It might be from a news article, scientific journal, really anywhere as long as it is public. Or share a bad data visualization and explain why it is so bad. Many examples are available at https://badvisualisations.tumblr.com/.
