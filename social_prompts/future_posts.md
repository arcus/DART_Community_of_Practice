# Potential Social Discussion Topics/Questions

Once a topic is used, remove it from this document and put it in [used_posts.md](used_posts.md).

- Is it "the data is" or "the data are," i.e. is the word data singular or plural? And does your belief match the way the words naturally come out of your mouth in conversation?
- Share your favorite (or least favorite, or most common) error message. What do you do when it appears?
- Share a data visualization you have particularly enjoyed. It might be from a news article, scientific journal, really anywhere as long as it is public. Or share a bad data visualization and explain why it is so bad. Many examples are available at https://badvisualisations.tumblr.com/.
- Find and post a cartoon that speaks to your experience with the program or with coding so far.
